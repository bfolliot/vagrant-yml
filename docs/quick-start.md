# Quick start

Download the last version of the Vagrantfile in your project directory :

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bfolliot/vagrant-yml/1.4.0/Vagrantfile
```

Create a file in the same directory with the name of `vagrant.yml`, if you want, you can use the example file :

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bfolliot/vagrant-yml/1.4.0/vagrant.yml.example -O vagrant.yml
```

Now, you can [personalize your configuration](YAML-configuration.md)
